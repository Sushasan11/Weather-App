# Weather-App
The Weather App is a simple and responsive application that allows users to fetch and display current weather information for any city by interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features a clean and intuitive user interface where users can input a city name to retrieve weather data such as temperature, humidity, and a brief weather description. The app is designed to handle errors gracefully, providing feedback if the city name is invalid or if there are issues with data retrieval. To set up the app, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. You'll also need an API key from OpenWeatherMap, which can be easily obtained by signing up on their website. Once you have the API key, replace the placeholder in the `script.js` file with your key to enable the app to fetch live weather data. The Weather App is a great starting point for anyone looking to build web applications that interact with external APIs and handle dynamic data.
